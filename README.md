## Hi! I'm Shahar!

### 🎓 Education
**Simon Fraser University**  
Joint Major in **Computing Science** & **Molecular Biology & Biochemistry**

I chose MBB+CS because I am driven to work at the cutting edge of biotechnology. I want to build the computational tools and apply the deep molecular-level understanding needed to turn groundbreaking research (like CRISPR) into real solutions that help people and accelerate science itself. The joint major gives me the perfect foundation: the hands-on lab techniques to understand the problems and the coding skills to build the solutions.
